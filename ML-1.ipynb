    "\n",
    "Ans. In order to solve a given problem of supervised learning, one has to perform the following steps:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1) Determine the type of training examples. Before doing anything else, the engineer should decide what kind of\n",
    "            data is to be used as an example. For instance, this might be a single handwritten character, an entire handwritten\n",
    "            word, or an entire line of handwriting.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        2) Gather a training set. The training set needs to be representative of the real-world use of the function. Thus, a set\n",
    "            of input objects is gathered and corresponding outputs are also gathered, either from human experts or from measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3) Determine the input feature representation of the learned function. The accuracy of the learned function depends\n",
    "            strongly on how the input object is represented. Typically, the input object is transformed into a feature vector,\n",
    "            which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object. The number of features should not be too\n",
    "            large, because of the curse of dimensionality; but should contain enough information to accurately predict the\n",
    "            output.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        4) Determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm. For example, the engineer\n",
    "            may choose to use support vector machines or decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "        5) Complete the design. Run the learning algorithm on the gathered training set. Some supervised learning algorithms require \n",
    "            the user to determine certain control parameters. These parameters may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset (called a  \n",
    "            validation set) of the training set, or via cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "        6) Evaluate the accuracy of the learned function. After parameter adjustment and learning, the performance of the \n",
    "            resulting function should be measured on a test set that is separate from the training set."
